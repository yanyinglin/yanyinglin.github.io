I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) with [Prof. Kejiang Ye](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~kejiang?language=en), currently visiting at the University of Pennsylvania DSL. My research focuses on **Operating/Network Systems**, **System for AI**, and **Distributed Systems**.

<!-- ## Research Interests

My work spans several key areas in systems research:

- **Large Language Model Systems**: Optimizing inference performance, pipeline parallelism, and serverless serving for LLMs
- **Network Systems**: Designing efficient network architectures for AI workloads and edge computing
- **Distributed Systems**: Building fault-tolerant, scalable systems for cloud and edge environments
- **Serverless Computing**: Performance optimization and resource orchestration for serverless platforms -->

## Research & Collaborations
I am currently working on Serverless LLM Systems, Generative Model Inference Systems, and Hardware Acceleration for Edge-Cloud Systems, with particular interests in Sparse Model Optimization and Reinforcement Learning for LLMs. My research focuses on advancing large-scale deep learning model inference through elastic heterogeneous pipelines, with an emphasis on performance-guaranteed serving systems.

I have had the privilege of collaborating with leading scholars in the field: [Prof. Rong Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/rong_chen) (SJTU), [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](https://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/) (UCSD), [Prof. Vincent Liu](https://vincen.tl/) (UPenn).

I spent over a year as a visiting scholar at UCSD, exploring FPGA-GPU parallel acceleration for LLM inference. I maintain close collaborations with Alibaba's infrastructure team and AIOS team, staying at the forefront of industry AI systems and ecosystems.
