I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, currently visiting at the University of Pennsylvania DSL. My research focuses on **Operating/Network Systems**, **System for AI**, and **Distributed Systems**.

## Research Interests

My work spans several key areas in systems research:

- **Large Language Model Systems**: Optimizing inference performance, pipeline parallelism, and serverless serving for LLMs
- **Network Systems**: Designing efficient network architectures for AI workloads and edge computing
- **Distributed Systems**: Building fault-tolerant, scalable systems for cloud and edge environments
- **Serverless Computing**: Performance optimization and resource orchestration for serverless platforms

## Current Work

I am currently working on advancing large-scale deep learning model inference through elastic heterogeneous pipelines, with a focus on performance-guaranteed LLM serving systems with fault-tolerated pipelines. My recent work includes developing network systems for resource-constrained edge environments and FPGA-based acceleration techniques for AI workloads.

## Publications

I have published extensively in top-tier conferences and journals, including EuroSys, SoCC, ICDCS, IEEE TSC, and IEEE TCC. My work has been recognized with multiple publications in leading venues, covering topics from serverless computing to large language model serving systems.
